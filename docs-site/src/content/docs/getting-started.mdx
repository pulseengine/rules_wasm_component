description: Quick start guide for building WebAssembly components with Bazel

## Welcome to the Future of Software Components

Ready to build software that's **portable**, **secure**, and **fast**? WebAssembly components let you write code once and run it anywhere - from web browsers to servers, IoT devices to desktop apps.

Think of WebAssembly components as **smart LEGO blocks** for software:
- **Plug-and-play**: Components from different languages work together seamlessly
- **Secure by design**: Each component runs in its own sandbox
- **Near-native speed**: Performance similar to compiled C/C++
- **Universal deployment**: Same component runs on any platform

**rules_wasm_component** makes building these components as easy as traditional software - no complex WebAssembly knowledge required!

## Prerequisites

- **Bazelisk** - [See installation guide](/installation/)
- **Git** - For cloning repositories
- **Language-specific tools** - Installed automatically by Bazel

## Installation

Add rules_wasm_component to your Bazel project:

### 1. Add to MODULE.bazel

```python title="MODULE.bazel"
bazel_dep(name = "rules_wasm_component", version = "1.0.0")

# Optional: Configure WASM toolchain version
wasm_toolchain = use_extension(
    "@rules_wasm_component//wasm:extensions.bzl",
    "wasm_toolchain",
)
wasm_toolchain.register(
    name = "wasm_tools",
    version = "1.235.0",  # Optional, defaults to latest stable
)

# Optional: Configure TinyGo toolchain version
tinygo = use_extension("@rules_wasm_component//wasm:extensions.bzl", "tinygo")
tinygo.register(
    name = "tinygo",
    tinygo_version = "0.38.0"  # Optional, defaults to 0.38.0
)
```

### 2. Add Rust dependencies (if using Rust)

```python title="MODULE.bazel"
bazel_dep(name = "rules_rust", version = "0.62.0")

# Configure crate dependencies
crate = use_extension("@rules_rust//crate_universe:extension.bzl", "crate")
crate.from_cargo(
    name = "crates",
    cargo_lockfile = "//:Cargo.lock",
    manifests = ["//:Cargo.toml"],
)
use_repo(crate, "crates")
```

```toml title="Cargo.toml"
[package]
name = "my-components"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
wit-bindgen = { version = "0.43.0", default-features = false, features = ["realloc"] }
```

## Getting Help

- **Documentation**: Browse this site for comprehensive guides
- **Examples**: Check the `/examples` directory in the repository
- **Issues**: Report bugs on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/pulseengine/rules_wasm_component/issues)
- **Discussions**: Ask questions in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/pulseengine/rules_wasm_component/discussions)

## Performance Note

<div class="perf-indicator">
Fast Builds: Bazel's incremental builds make iteration quick
</div>

Components built with these rules benefit from:
- **Bazel's build caching** - Only rebuild what changed
- **Hermetic toolchains** - Consistent builds across environments
- **Parallel compilation** - Build multiple components simultaneously
- **Wizer pre-initialization** - 1.35-6x startup performance improvements
