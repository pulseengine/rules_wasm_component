# Zero to Component in 2 Minutes

**Goal**: Get a working WebAssembly component in under 2 minutes, with minimal setup and maximum success.

This ultra-quick start guide gets you from nothing to a working component as fast as possible. Once you see it working, you can dive deeper into the concepts.

## Prerequisites Check ✅

You only need **one** tool installed:

```bash
# Check if you have bazelisk (recommended) or bazel
bazelisk version || bazel version
```

**Don't have it?** Install bazelisk in 30 seconds:
```bash
# macOS
brew install bazelisk

# Linux/Windows with npm
npm install -g @bazel/bazelisk

# Or download binary from: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/releases
```

## Step 1: Get the Code (30 seconds)

```bash
# Clone and enter the basic example
git clone https://github.com/pulseengine/rules_wasm_component.git
cd rules_wasm_component/examples/basic
```

**What's in here?** Just 3 simple files:
- `hello.wit` - The interface (what your component does)
- `src/lib.rs` - The implementation (7 lines of Rust)  
- `BUILD.bazel` - The build config (tells Bazel how to build it)

## Step 2: Build Your Component (60 seconds)

```bash
# Build the component (first run downloads tools automatically)
bazelisk build //:hello_component

# ✅ Success looks like:
# INFO: Build completed successfully, X total actions
```

**What just happened?** Bazel automatically:
- Downloaded Rust toolchain + WebAssembly tools
- Compiled your 7-line Rust code to WebAssembly
- Created `hello_component.wasm` - your finished component!

## Step 3: See It Work (30 seconds)

```bash
# Look at what was created
ls bazel-bin/
# You should see: hello_component.wasm

# Check the component interface
bazelisk run @wasm_tools_toolchains//:wasm_tools -- component wit bazel-bin/hello_component.wasm

# Expected output:
# package hello:component@0.1.0;
# 
# world hello {
#     export hello: func(name: string) -> string;
# }
```

**🎉 Congratulations!** You just built a WebAssembly component that:
- Exports a `hello` function that takes a string and returns a string
- Can be called from any language (JavaScript, Python, Go, etc.)
- Runs in a secure sandbox with no access to your system
- Works on any platform that supports WebAssembly

## What You Just Built

Let's quickly understand the 3 files that made this magic happen:

### The Interface (`hello.wit`)
```wit
package hello:component@0.1.0;

world hello {
    export hello: func(name: string) -> string;
}
```
**This says**: "My component exports one function called `hello` that takes a string parameter and returns a string."

### The Implementation (`src/lib.rs`)
```rust
wit_bindgen::generate!();

struct Component;

impl Guest for Component {
    fn hello(name: String) -> String {
        format!("Hello, {}!", name)
    }
}

export!(Component);
```
**This says**: "Here's my Rust code that implements the `hello` function - it just adds 'Hello, ' to whatever name you give it."

### The Build Config (`BUILD.bazel`)
```python
load("@rules_wasm_component//wit:defs.bzl", "wit_library")
load("@rules_wasm_component//rust:defs.bzl", "rust_wasm_component_bindgen")

wit_library(
    name = "hello_interfaces",
    srcs = ["hello.wit"],
    package_name = "hello:component@0.1.0",
)

rust_wasm_component_bindgen(
    name = "hello_component",
    srcs = ["src/lib.rs"],
    wit = ":hello_interfaces",
)
```
**This says**: "Bazel, please take my WIT interface and Rust code, and build me a WebAssembly component."

## Why This Matters

You just experienced the **Component Model revolution**:

1. **Write once, run anywhere**: Your component works on any platform
2. **Language freedom**: The same interface could be implemented in Go, C++, JavaScript, etc.
3. **Secure by default**: Components can't access your filesystem or network unless explicitly allowed
4. **Composable**: You can connect multiple components together like LEGO blocks

This is the future of software development - and you just took your first step into it! 🎊
