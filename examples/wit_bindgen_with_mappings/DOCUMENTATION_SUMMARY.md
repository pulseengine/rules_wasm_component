#### 3. **WIT Bindgen Troubleshooting** (`docs-site/guides/wit-bindgen-troubleshooting.mdx`)

**Purpose**: Common issues, debugging, and language-specific solutions
**Key Topics**:

- Common configuration errors and solutions
- Language-specific troubleshooting (Rust lifetimes, JavaScript Promises, Go error handling)
- Performance troubleshooting (binary size, runtime performance)
- Best practices by use case (library, service, integration components)
- Debugging tools and techniques
- Comprehensive error analysis with root cause diagrams

#### 4. **Updated Host vs WASM Bindings** (`docs-site/guides/host-vs-wasm-bindings.mdx`)

**Enhancement**: Added references to advanced topics

- Links to new comprehensive guides
- Context for when to use advanced features

## Key Concepts Explained with Diagrams

### üéØ **Interface Mapping Architecture**

- Component Model duplication problem visualization
- Interface mapping decision trees
- Type system boundary mappings across languages
- Memory layout implications by ownership model

### üèóÔ∏è **Language-Specific Patterns**

- Rust ownership trichotomy (owning/borrowing/cow)
- JavaScript Promise handling and memory boundaries
- Go resource management and error patterns
- Multi-language async model comparisons

### ‚ö° **Performance Analysis**

- Binary size breakdown pie charts
- Compilation time impact flowcharts
- Runtime performance comparison tables
- Memory usage patterns by configuration

## Implementation Validation

### ‚úÖ **Successful Build Tests**

1. Basic bindings generation
2. Enhanced features (ownership, derives)
3. CLI argument construction validation
4. Generated code quality verification

### üîß **Working Features Demonstrated**

- `with_mappings`: Interface and type remappings
- `ownership`: Memory management models
- `additional_derives`: Custom trait implementations
- `format_code`: Code formatting control
- `generate_all`: Generation scope control
- `async_interfaces`: Async/await pattern enablement

## Usage Patterns by Language

### **Rust Components**

- Zero-copy optimization with borrowing
- Custom derives for ecosystem integration
- Async patterns for tokio integration
- WASI interface mapping to reduce duplication

### **JavaScript Components**

- Natural async handling
- Memory boundary management
- TypedArray integration patterns

### **Go Components**

- Error handling patterns
- Resource lifecycle management
- Synchronous operation optimization

## Migration and Best Practices

### **Migration Strategy**

1. Start with basic configuration
2. Add interface mappings for common WASI types
3. Optimize ownership model for performance
4. Add derives incrementally as needed
5. Enable async for specific operations

### **Performance Optimization**

- Map common interfaces to reduce binary size
- Choose appropriate ownership model
- Select derives judiciously
- Configure async selectively

## Documentation Philosophy

This documentation follows a **language-aware, architecture-first** approach:

1. **Explains the "why"** behind each feature
2. **Shows language-specific implications** with concrete examples
3. **Uses visual diagrams** to clarify complex concepts
4. **Provides troubleshooting** for real-world issues
5. **Includes performance analysis** for optimization decisions

The enhanced `wit_bindgen` rule bridges the gap between wit-bindgen's powerful CLI capabilities and Bazel's structured build system, while the comprehensive documentation ensures developers understand the sophisticated concepts and can apply them effectively across different languages and use cases.
