"""
Example demonstrating WebAssembly runtime integration concepts.

NOTE: This example is currently disabled due to missing wasmtime dependencies.
The source files demonstrate the architecture for wasmtime integration but
require wasmtime and wasmtime-wasi crates to be added to the project's
Cargo.toml/MODULE.bazel configuration.

To enable this example:
1. Add wasmtime crates to the project dependencies
2. Uncomment the targets below
3. Update the crate references as needed

The source files in src/ demonstrate:
- Component loading and instantiation
- Host function registration
- Runtime configuration
- Performance monitoring
- Multi-component orchestration
