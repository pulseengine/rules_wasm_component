# Microservices Architecture with WAC + OCI

This example demonstrates a complete, production-ready microservices architecture using WebAssembly components composed with WAC (WebAssembly Composition) and distributed via OCI (Open Container Initiative) registries.

## Architecture Overview

The example showcases three major architectural patterns:

### üõí E-commerce Platform

- **Frontend**: Web application with React-like functionality
- **Services**: User management, product catalog, inventory, orders, shopping cart
- **External**: Payment processing, fraud detection, notifications
- **Infrastructure**: Search, analytics, recommendations

### üè¶ Financial Services Platform

- **Clients**: API gateway, mobile banking app
- **Core Services**: Accounts, transactions, balances, loans
- **Security**: Authentication, KYC, fraud monitoring, audit logging
- **External**: Credit bureau, payment rails
- **Analytics**: Risk assessment, regulatory reporting

### üåê IoT Edge Platform

- **Edge**: Local gateway with real-time processing
- **Device Management**: Registry, configuration, OTA updates
- **Data Pipeline**: Ingestion, stream processing, batch analytics
- **Storage**: Time-series database, data warehouse
- **AI/ML**: Inference engine, anomaly detection

## Key Features Demonstrated

### üîÄ Multi-Registry Architecture

```bazel
registries = [
    "local|localhost:5000|oci",                                    # Development
    "github|ghcr.io|oci|env|GITHUB_TOKEN",                        # Open source
    "docker|docker.io|oci|env|DOCKER_TOKEN",                      # Third-party
    "aws|*.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com|oci|oauth|...",        # Production
    "azure|*.azurecr.io|oci|basic|...",                           # Backup
    "google|us-central1-docker.pkg.dev|oci|oauth|...",            # ML services
]
```

### üîê Enterprise Security

- **Component Signing**: All production components digitally signed
- **Registry Authentication**: Multiple auth methods (OAuth, tokens, basic)
- **Security Policies**: Enforce signing requirements per environment
- **Compliance**: SOC2, PCI-DSS, regulatory audit trails

### üöÄ Deployment Patterns

- **Development**: Local mocks + minimal containerized services
- **Staging**: Production-like with test data and staging registries
- **Production**: Full service mesh with enterprise security
- **Canary**: Traffic splitting between stable and canary versions

### üìä Observability

- **Distributed Tracing**: Request flow across all services
- **Metrics Collection**: Performance, business, and system metrics
- **Centralized Logging**: Structured logs with correlation IDs
- **Health Monitoring**: Service health checks and circuit breakers

## Examples Breakdown

### 1. E-commerce Platform

```bazel
wac_microservices_app(
    name = "ecommerce_platform",
    frontend_component = ":web_frontend",
    services = {
        # Core business logic
        "user_service": "ghcr.io/company/ecommerce/user-service:v2.1.0",
        "product_catalog": "ghcr.io/company/ecommerce/product-catalog:v1.8.0",
        "inventory_service": "ghcr.io/company/ecommerce/inventory:v1.5.0",
        "order_service": "ghcr.io/company/ecommerce/orders:v2.0.0",

        # External services
        "payment_processor": "docker.io/stripe/payment-processor:v3.2.0",
        "fraud_detection": "docker.io/sift/fraud-detection:v2.0.0",

        # Infrastructure
        "search_service": "123456789.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/search:v2.5.0",
        "recommendation_engine": "us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/company/ml/recommendations:v1.8.0",

            "mobile_app": ":mobile_app",
        },
        "oci": {
            # Highly regulated core services
            "account_service": "ghcr.io/bank/core/accounts:v3.0.0",
            "transaction_service": "ghcr.io/bank/core/transactions:v2.8.0",

## Operational Procedures

### Incident Response

1. **Detection**: Monitoring alerts trigger incident
2. **Triage**: Determine severity and impact
3. **Isolation**: Circuit breakers isolate failing services
4. **Rollback**: Quick rollback to last known good version
5. **Recovery**: Gradual traffic restoration after fix

### Capacity Planning

- **Traffic Forecasting**: Predict load based on business metrics
- **Resource Scaling**: Auto-scaling based on utilization
- **Cost Optimization**: Right-sizing instances and services
- **Performance Testing**: Regular load testing and benchmarking

### Disaster Recovery

- **Backup Strategy**: Regular backups of critical data
- **Multi-Region**: Deploy across multiple availability zones
- **Failover**: Automated failover to backup systems
- **Recovery Testing**: Regular DR drills and validation

## Best Practices

### Architecture Principles

- **Single Responsibility**: Each service has one clear purpose
- **Loose Coupling**: Services communicate via well-defined APIs
- **High Cohesion**: Related functionality grouped together
- **Stateless Design**: Services don't maintain client state

### Development Guidelines

- **API First**: Design APIs before implementation
- **Versioning**: Semantic versioning for backward compatibility
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive API and deployment docs
- **Testing**: Automated testing at all levels

### Operational Excellence

- **Infrastructure as Code**: All infrastructure defined in code
- **Continuous Deployment**: Automated deployment pipelines
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive observability across all layers
- **Security**: Defense in depth, principle of least privilege

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

#### Service Discovery Failures

```bash
# Check service registration
kubectl get services -n microservices

# Verify DNS resolution
nslookup user-service.microservices.svc.cluster.local
```

#### Authentication Problems

```bash
# Verify JWT tokens
echo $JWT_TOKEN | base64 -d | jq .

# Check certificate validity
openssl x509 -in cert.pem -text -noout
```

#### Performance Issues

```bash
# Check resource utilization
kubectl top pods -n microservices

# Analyze slow queries
kubectl logs -f deployment/database-service
```

#### Network Connectivity

```bash
# Test service-to-service communication
kubectl exec -it frontend-pod -- curl http://user-service:8080/health

# Check network policies
kubectl get networkpolicies -n microservices
```
