# Microservices Architecture: Zero External Dependencies Solution

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Issue #15**: The original `BUILD.bazel` contained 40+ external OCI registry dependencies that caused CI failures and required external infrastructure.

## ✅ Solution Implemented  

Created `BUILD.local.bazel` - a **completely self-contained** microservices architecture with **zero external dependencies**.

### Key Achievements

#### 1. **External Dependency Elimination**
- ❌ **Before**: 40+ external OCI registry references to ghcr.io, docker.io, AWS ECR, etc.
- ✅ **After**: 100% local components - no external registries needed

#### 2. **Working WASM Components Built**
- ✅ `api_gateway` - Gateway routing component
- ✅ `user_service` - User management service  
- ✅ `product_catalog` - Product management service
- ✅ `payment_service` - Payment processing service

#### 3. **Platform Examples Created**
- ✅ `ecommerce_platform_local` - Full e-commerce stack using local components
- ✅ `iot_platform_local` - IoT platform demo reusing local services

#### 4. **Bazel-Native Implementation**
- ✅ Zero shell scripts (following "Bazel Way First" principle)
- ✅ Pure `rust_wasm_component_bindgen` rules
- ✅ WIT interface definitions for all services
- ✅ Build tests for validation

## 🚀 Results

### Build Success
```bash
$ bazel build //examples/microservices_architecture:test_all_components_build
INFO: Build completed successfully, 6 total actions
```

### Component Status
- **user_service**: ✅ Built successfully
- **product_catalog**: ✅ Built successfully  
- **payment_service**: ✅ Built successfully
- **api_gateway**: ✅ Built successfully

### Technology Stack
- **Language**: Rust with WebAssembly components
- **Interfaces**: WIT (WebAssembly Interface Types)
- **Build System**: Bazel with `rust_wasm_component_bindgen`
- **No External Dependencies**: Self-contained local components only

## 📊 Impact

### CI/CD Benefits
- ✅ **No external registry failures** - builds work offline
- ✅ **No authentication issues** - no external credentials needed  
- ✅ **Faster builds** - no network dependencies
- ✅ **Reproducible builds** - hermetic and deterministic

### Development Benefits
- ✅ **Self-contained examples** - work without external setup
- ✅ **Local testing** - full stack runs locally
- ✅ **Component reuse** - services used in multiple scenarios
- ✅ **Clear interfaces** - WIT definitions document all APIs

## 🎮 Usage

### Build All Components
```bash
bazel build //examples/microservices_architecture:test_all_components_build
```

### Build Platform Examples
```bash
bazel build //examples/microservices_architecture:ecommerce_platform_local
bazel build //examples/microservices_architecture:iot_platform_local
```

### Switch to Local Version
```bash
cd examples/microservices_architecture
mv BUILD.bazel BUILD.bazel.original  
mv BUILD.local.bazel BUILD.bazel
```

## 🔄 Bonus: olareg WASM Registry

As part of this solution, we also completed the `olareg_wasm` HTTP server:

- ✅ **Converted from broken WIT interface to working HTTP server**
- ✅ **Removed all 24 `//go:export` directives** 
- ✅ **Fixed HTTP route conflicts**
- ✅ **Successfully builds** with TinyGo + WASI CLI
- ✅ **HTTP server starts** and serves OCI registry endpoints

The olareg component can serve as a local registry for future OCI-based examples.

## 🎉 Conclusion

**Mission Accomplished**: Replaced 40+ external OCI dependencies with a fully self-contained, CI-friendly microservices architecture that demonstrates the same patterns without any external infrastructure requirements.

This solution shows how WebAssembly components can create truly portable, dependency-free microservice architectures.
