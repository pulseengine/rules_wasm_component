"""Cross-package C++ header dependency test

This test reproduces the issue described in #38 where cross-package C++ headers
are not properly staged in the compilation workspace, causing "file not found" errors.

Test Structure:
- foundation_lib: Provides foundation/types.h header in a separate package
- consumer_component: Uses the foundation header via #include "foundation/types.h"
