"""Platform definitions for the main workspace"""

# This file provides platform definitions for the main rules_wasm_component workspace
# It's separate from tools-builder/platforms/defs.bzl which is specific to the tool builder

# Standard platform definitions already exist in platforms/BUILD.bazel
# This file can be used for any cross-workspace platform logic if needed

# For now, this is a minimal file to satisfy load dependencies
